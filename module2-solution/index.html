                <p class="boxContent"> Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
                    Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or 
                    hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just "chicken") and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.
